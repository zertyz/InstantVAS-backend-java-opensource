SMSInParser
===========

This project establishes the foundations for incoming message parsers for the various SMS gateways
that we're going to deal with.

By having the same foundation we can achieve some advantages, like easily replacing the gateway on
ongoing projects -- using the factory pattern, for instance -- and code reuse on incoming SMS
routing -- enqueueing, for example.

This project defines a common class to rule out how messages coming from various sources (by an
HttpServlet, for instance) should be parsed and replied.
