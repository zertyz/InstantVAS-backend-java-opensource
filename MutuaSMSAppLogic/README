MutuaSMSAppLogic
================

Unites all the common logic aspects of a SMS application or game, to know:

	- MO / MT / Broadcasting
	- command recognition & navigation among states
	- Session manipulation
	- all common sms commands, like "welcome", "help", "short helps" and "exit"
	- phrasing mechanisms
	- configuration

A full "Logic" component of an SMS App

The recommended usage for this project is derive it on a new project, together with
'MutuaSMSAppModule' derived modules. For instance:

	MutuaSMSAppLogicHangman:
		MutuaSMSAppLogic
		MutuaSMSAppModuleHangman
		MutuaSMSAppModuleUsers
		MutuaSMSAppModuleSubscription
		MutuaSMSAppModuleChat
		MutuaSMSAppModuleRaffle
		MutuaSMSAppModulePrizes

The 'MutuaSMSAppLogicHangman' newly created project should, then, apply any left to be applied
glue on all of the modules.
