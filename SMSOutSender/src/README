SMSOutSender
============

This project establishes the foundation for outgoing SMSes to whatever gateway we're using.

ongoing projects and code reuse on outgoing routing -- enqueueing, for example.

This project defines a common class to rule out how messages going to different destinations (an http
service, for instance) should be invoked
